            <h2>Privacy Policy:</h2>
            <h3>Welcome to Nyki's Websites</h3>
            <p class="last-updated">Our Terms &#38; Conditions were last updated on <time datetime="2024-02-19">February 19th 2024</time></time></p>
            <p>
                <center><strong>We are committed to honoring your privacy.</strong></center>
                <br/>
                The ODU computer science student that coded this website, Nyki, respects your right to privacy. She developed this Privacy Statement to inform you about her practices. If you have any questions regarding this Privacy Statement, please direct your inquiries to her using the contact form found at the bottom of this statement (as well as in the footer of all pages).
                <br/><br/>
                Privacy is a concern to most people. This programmer is acutely aware of, and sensitive to, the privacy concerns of the users of the sites she has programmed. Be assured that she does not sell information about her users to third parties.
                <br/><br/>
                The programmer of the current site and all those served at her personal domain on the ODU Linux server, will hereafter be referred to as <em>ours</em> and the programmer herself will be referred to as <em>us</em>. The users of the current site and all those serverd at our personal domain on the ODU linux server, will hereafter be referred to as <em>you</em>.
                <br/><br/>
                As a student of computer science at ODU, we are committed to processing personal informationn about you in ways that comply with our legal obligations as well as being clear with you about what we do with your personal information.
                <br/><br/>
                Some of the key points of our privacy statement are:
                <ul>
                    <li>We <em>do not</em> sell your data to third parties.</li>
                    <li>We <em>do</em> make it easy for you to manage your information, you can change your communication preferences at any time.</li>
                    <li>We <em>do</em> use your data to help provide an improved user experience, which can include limited tailoring of the information shared with you to help ensure that it is relevant, useful, and timely.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>What information do we collect?</li>
                    <p>We may collect your name, email, age, profile avatar, and other "light" personal information. This information is not used for demographic purposes but rather to create a unique profile in some sites.</p>
                <li>How do we use your personal information?</li>
                    <p>We use your information only so far as to create a personal profile that you may access as your "Dashboard" and in certain sites, information that you explicitly allow, will be shared with other users. The default is opt-in and therefore, no information is shared with other users until and unless you grant this information to be shared.</p>
                <li>How long is your personal information kept?</li>
                    <p>The personal information that you input into this or any other site managed by us, will only be kept for the duration of ODU's Spring 2024 semester. Any use or availability thereafter is unintended and such content will be removed once reported to us.</p>
                <li>How is your personal information kept safe?</li>
                    <p>We are currently in pursuit of a B.S. in computer science and thus may be forgiven for having a limited knowledge of best security practices in all cases. Though this knowledge will certainly improve throughout the semester, we cannot assure you that your personal information will be perfectly safeguarded against security risk.
                        <br/><br/>
                        It is in our best intention to provide you with a secure and safe space to explore the sites we provide, however, we are not liable for any unmitigated accesses to your information, outside of what is learned in the CS 312 course and gleaned from outside sources through our own research.
                        <br/><br/>
                        Every effort will be made to secure your information but it is assumed by use of these sites, that this privacy statement and any other notices of privacy expecation are accepted by you expressly.
                        <br/><br/>
                        Ultimately, you enter our sites at your own risk and any information you provide therein should be "light" and informal so as to match the spirit of the educational process. This is a student managed domain; expectations should be tempered.</p>
                <li>Your rights</li>
                    <p>You, the user, are the most important facet of our sites. Without you, we would have little basis for existing. By these merits, you retain the right to privacy and the control of how that privacy is managed. You are the ultimate arbitor of your information and any doubt in our abilities to maintain this right or direct infringements to it, may be brought to our attention and will be handled with the utmost severity.
                        <br/><br/>
                        Please, understand your rights are not limited to those listed in this privacy statement. The manner in which we conduct our Internet decorum should be understood as <em>opt-in</em>. You opt-in to any services and/or use of the information you provide us in within our sites. By default you are opted-out of any and all services.
                        <br/><br/>
                        Further, your information is, by default, only visible and accessible to our administration and yourself. You are in control. Proceed for more rights you may observe while exploring our sites.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The right to be informed</li>
                            <p>You reserve the right to be informed and warned when your personal information will be stored, collected, or shared. It is our pleasure to provide you an opt-in platform for privacy as you may explicitly allow as much or little of your information to be shared outside of your profile or dashboard. No information will be shared within the site or to third parties without your consent.</p>
                        <li>The right to rectification</li>
                            <p>If you feel your privacy has been neglected, infringed upon, or unfairly handled you have the right to rectify the situation. Such matters will be handled swiftly and honored without further inquiries as to the nature or reasoning behind your discomfort. All issues should be reported to us through the appropriate email channels. Your privacy is our concern. Keep us honest.</p>
                        <li>The right to erasure</li>
                            <p>You reserve the right to completely erase and disable any accounts made within our sites. This can either be done within the site itself or if unavailable, may requested by contacting us at the provided email.</p>
                    </ul>
                <li>Updates to this or any other legal statements</li>
                    <p>Please note, that if and when this privacy statment or any other legal statement is updated or otherwise altered, you will be informed at the moment it becomes valid. This will be done either via your personal dashboard, email, or as a general site banner that will be clearly marked as to the nature of relevant revisions.
                        <br/><br/>
                        This privacy statement is a promise to you, the user, and will not be used in any manner that does not better serve and uphold the integrity of your privacy. Any use outside of that purpose, is invalid.</p>
                <li>Contact Us!</li>
                    <p>For further information regarding these rights, about this Privacy Statement generally, or to open an issue please use the form at the footer of any page (including this one).
                        <br/><br/>
                        Please provide as much information as possible to help us identify the information you are requesting, the action you want us to take, and we will not inquire beyond that.
                        <br/><br/>
                        We will generally respond to your request within one business day of receipt of your request. We will not stop until your issue or question has been addressed to your satisfaction.
                        <br/><br/>
                        If after contacting us you are still unhappy with the services you received, you may also request to have your issue elevated to our professor. Contact information will be provided if such a situation arises.
